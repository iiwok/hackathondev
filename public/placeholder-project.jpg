PLACEHOLDER IMAGE INSTRUCTIONS

Please create a placeholder image file named 'placeholder-project.jpg' in your public directory.

You can use any generic project/hackathon related image of your choice - something that shows code, technology, or a team working together.

If you don't have an image readily available, you can generate one using an image generation service or download a royalty-free placeholder from sites like Unsplash or Pexels.

This image will be used as a fallback for project cards when no specific image is provided.
